# Axiom Geometric Patterns

Welcome to the **Axiom Geometric Patterns** project!

This project uses JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element to generate random geometric patterns. It's a creative playground for experimenting with shapes, colors, and motion.

## Features
- Dynamic generation of geometric patterns
- Uses HTML5 canvas for rendering
- Randomized shapes, colors, and positions on each refresh

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/37_Mon_RandomLab_Axiom.git
